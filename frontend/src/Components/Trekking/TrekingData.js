    description: 'The Gaumukh Tapovan trek is a thrillfest with gigantic views of the cow-shaped Gaumukh Glacier which is also one of the main water sources of the holy Ganges. The trek offers breathtaking views of the Gangotri peaks - Shivling, Thalay Sagar, and Meru. The Gomukh Tapovan trek is scenic with natures bounty and is decorated with fragrant flowers, snow-capped peaks, and similar jaw-dropping views. Take a dip in the holy Bhagirathi River, which is considered one of the sacred rituals. During the Gomukh glacier trek, one can also immerse in the divine aura of the pilgrim cities- Rishikesh, Uttarkashi, Gangotri, and Bhojwassa. Marvel at the sight of the Bhagirathi sisters to experience the summit views.',
